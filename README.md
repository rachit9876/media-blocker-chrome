## What's New

- **Instagram Pro (Downloader & 1-Click Live Copier `insta-dl`):** Download highest-resolution photos, videos, stories, and reels on Instagram. Features an instant **1-Click Live Copy** button to copy full-resolution PNG images directly to your system clipboard for instant pasting (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>) into Discord, WhatsApp Web, Slack, etc. without downloading any files!
- **Accurate Story Media Handling:** Automatically distinguishes between still photo stories (`.jpg`) and video stories (`.mp4`), fixing the common bug in other downloaders where static photo stories were forced into video format.
- **Visual Image Search & Snipping Tool:** Right-click to search images via Google Lens, Yandex, or TinEye. Use the "Search Area" tool in the popup to snip and search any part of your screen!
- **Tab Scoped Settings:** Click "ALL TABS / THIS TAB" in the popup to apply filters and privacy modes to only the currently active tab without affecting the rest of your browser.
- **QR Code Generator:** Right-click to generate a QR code for the current page, link, or media. A custom QR generator is also available in the popup.
- **Text Spoofing:** Converts visible page text into deterministic, seed-based typoglycemic text to prevent shoulder-surfing.
- **Domain Lock & Browser Lock:** Require your universal password before opening selected websites or lock the entire browser.
- **URL Shortener:** Shorten current pages, links, images, video, and audio URLs, with recent history and QR preview.
- **Smart Dark Mode:** Applies a dark-style inversion only when the current site appears light.
